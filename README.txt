To encode the passwords:

1. Make sure you have the python file "encodeMD5.py" and the text file "38650-password-sktorrent.txt" in the same directory
2. Navigate to the directory, then just type "python encodeMD5.py"
3. The script will encode the list of passwords, and you will get the output in a text file called "passwords_MD5.csv"
